## Description

_{This application considers the following specifications:
    -The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain         consonants or vowels.  
    -Identifies vowels.
    -For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive          consonants to the end.
    -For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
    -If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
    -The program adds "ay" to single-letter words.
